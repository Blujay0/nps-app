# **Wander**

Wander is a single page JavaScript application that enables you to search national parks throughout the United States. You can filter parks by name, state, and available activities. Additionally, you can add parks to your favorites for your next trip.

## **Installation**
Fork and clone this repository. Navigate to the directory on your local device. If you are using VS Code, run code . to open the content. You will need to secure an API key from the National Parks Service to effectively use the application. Request a free key [here](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm). The key will be sent to your email within a few minutes. Add a new file to your directory: touch config.js. Define a variable API_KEY and set it equal to a string for your new key value. You should now be able to run (on Mac devices) open index.html or (on Windows devices) explorer.exe index.html.
